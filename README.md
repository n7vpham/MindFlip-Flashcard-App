## üéì Project Context

This project was developed as part of **ITSC 4155 ‚Äì Software Development Projects** at UNC Charlotte.
I, **Nam Pham**, handled the **entire frontend development**, including:

* Creating all HTML templates
* Implementing flashcard and canvas animations
* Adding frontend input validation

I also supported backend development by assisting with backend validation logic, integrating profile update functionality, and implementing the filtering systems for sets and flashcards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account**

* Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register).
* Sign up using Google, GitHub, or manually with email and password.

2. **Deploy a Cluster**

* After logging in, click "Create a Cluster".
* Choose the Free Tier.
* Select:

  * Provider: AWS (default)
  * Region: N. Virginia (us-east-1) (recommended)
  * Cluster name: leave as default (Cluster0)
* Click "Create Deployment".

3. **Connect to Your Cluster**

* Click **Connect** next to your cluster.
* MongoDB will automatically detect your IP address.
* It will also **auto-generate a Database User** with random username and password.
* You can accept the auto-generated user, or create your own username and password manually.
* This database user is needed later for your application to connect.

4. **Choose a Connection Method**

* After creating your database user, MongoDB Atlas asks you to **choose a connection method**.
* Select **Drivers** (Node.js, Python, etc.).
  ![Choose Driver Option](images/5.png)

5. **Copy the Connection String**

* MongoDB will now display your **connection string**.
* This string is needed to connect from your application.
* Replace `<username>` and `<password>` in the connection string with your database credentials.

### üêç Python Virtual Environment Setup

Before starting the app, you will need to configure your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following lines:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.p59rbqf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>
```

Then, in your terminal or bash shell, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
flask run
```
